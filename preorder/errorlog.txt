Frontend/backend mismatch on voucher response (2025-10-01)

Summary
- Backend (preorder_action.php, action=save) echoes voucher HTML via printVoucher($vno) on success.
- Frontend previously expected numeric code 1 and thus treated HTML as error.

Impact
- Voucher modal did not show; fields not reset.

Fix
- Frontend now interprets numeric 2/3/4 as errors; otherwise treats response as voucher HTML and renders it into #vouchermodal .modal-body, then shows the modal and resets fields.

Recommendation
- Prefer JSON contract for clarity, e.g. { status: "ok", html: "..." }.
